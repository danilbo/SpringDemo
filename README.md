# SpringDemo

Simple spring project to maintain DataBase with 3 tables: Books, Reader, History  
This project is simple simulation of library reader/book database
User may get different request via this project to DataBase(by params like ...?author=Author Name, ?tittle=BookTitle)
There is criteria builder in this project, it's helps to build custom search into database (by different fields)
Also created different views for different tasks

This is my training project, so it have bad code formatting
